# Assessment Grading Rubric
## Short Response Section
### Technical Score
* **3**: A score of 3 indicates that a response is technically sound, accounts for edge cases, and uses the correct vocabulary, and all parts of the question have been answered.

* **2**: A score of 2 indicates that, generally, your response is technically sound but may be missing some detail or is being communicated with overly general language.
* **1**: A score of 1 indicates that you have left out or incorrectly communicated an important concept. A score of 1 indicates that you have a significant knowledge gap that you must revisit.
* **0**: Questions receive a 0 if they are left blank or are completely incorrect, technically.

### Writing Score
* **3**: A score of 3 indicates that your communication is clear, concise, and typo/grammar error free. In a word, 3 stands for _flawless_. If code snippet is required, it must follow all convention, and have correct syntax.
* **2**: A response would receive a 2 if there are minor typos/grammar errors OR if a response is long-winded or slightly unclear.
* **1**: A response receives a 1 if there are multiple or major spelling/grammer errors OR if your response was so unclear that it is difficult to infer your main idea.
* **0**: Questions receive a 0 if they are left blank or answered with disrespectfully low effort.

## Code Katas
### Algorithm Score
* **3**: Your algorithm solves the problem efficiently and it is implemented correctly.
* **2**: Your algorithm solves the problem but does so in an inefficient manner OR your algorithm has a minor error in implementation.
* **1**: There is a major or multiple minor errors in the implementation of your algorithm.
* **0**: Your algorithm will not produce any solution to the given problem, or the solution is grossly incorrect.

### Code Style
* **3**: Your code is readable, conventional, and utilizes ES6 features to enhance readability efficiency. All variables and functions are thoughtfully named.
* **2**: Your code has minor style errors (spacing, quotations, etc), vague variable names.
* **1**: Your code has multiple style errors, poorly named variables, or minor syntax errors. 
* **0**: Your code has major syntax errors.

### Design Score
* **3**: Your design has all of the required features implemented cleanly, your design's features are thoroughly tested, and your code is free of errors (or mostly free of errors).
* **2**: Your design has all of the required features, but your code is not tested and/or contains a minor error(s).
* **1**: Your design does not implement a required feature, is not tested and contains major errors.
* **0**: Your design does not implement most of the required features.

Above-and-beyond features:
* Code handles failure well (bad inputs to methods are handled gracefully)
* Items are represented as a class/object rather than just a string
* There are additional features beyond what was required (removing AND marking as complete, prioritization of items, printing out the contents, etc...)

## Total Possible Points on Unit 4 Assessment
* **Design Challange:** 6 Point (this question has a design score of 3 and Code style of 3 to be summed up)
* **Short Response Section:** 15 points (each question has a technical score of 3 points to be summed up)
* **Code Katas Section:** 18 points (each question has a algorithm and code style score to be summsed up)
* **Writing Average:** 3 points (take the average of all non-zero scores to determine _writing average score_)
